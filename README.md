# mathOperationsAPI

This API supports computation of different mathematical functions and provides a generated graphical UI (Swagger) with FastAPI.

---

## Tech Stack

- **Backend:** FastAPI and Python
- **Database:** SQLite (managed by SQLAlchemy)
- **Frontend:** Swagger UI (auto-generated by FastAPI)

---

## Functionalities

- **DB storage in SQLite** with timestamp.
- **Mathematical operations:** power, fibonacci sum, factorial.
- **Asynchronicity** for performing operations.
- **Deletion of stored data.**
- **Authorization for deletion** with Bearer token.
- **Logging of performed operations** in `operations.log`.
- **Local caching** using a dictionary to prevent duplicate values for computation.

## Installation & Running the App

1. Install requirements:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2. Start the server:
    ```sh
    uvicorn main:app --reload
    ```
    This will start the server, accessible at:

## Example API Calls (using Postman or similar tools)

**Compute:**
- Endpoint: `POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/compute`
- Example bodies:
    ```json
    {
      "operation": "pow",
      "operand1": 2,
      "operand2": 4
    }
    ```
    or
    ```json
    {
      "operation": "fib",
      "operand1": 9
    }
    ```
    or
    ```json
    {
      "operation": "fact",
      "operand1": 2,
      "operand2": 4
    }
    ```

**Delete:**  
(Delete by ID or delete all. You will need to create a `config.py` file where you initialize a token for auth like `BEARER_TOKEN = "something"`)
- By ID:  
  `DELETE http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1/operations/{replace_with_existing_operation_id}`
- Delete all:  
  `DELETE http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1/operations`

**Get:**  
- By ID:  
  `GET http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1/operations/{replace_with_existing_id}`
- Get all:  
  `GET http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1/operations`

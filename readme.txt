mathOperationsAPI

This API supports computation of different mathematical functions and a generated graphical UI is generated by Swagger for FastAPI.

Tech Stack:
- FastAPI and Python for backend
- SQLite database (and SQLAlchemy for management)
- Swagger UI frontend

Functionalities:
- DB storage in SQLite with timestamp
- Mathematical operations: power, fibonacci sum, factorial
- Asynchronicity for performing operations
- Deletion of stored data
- Authorization for deletion with Bearer token
- Logging of performed operations in operations.log
- Local caching using a dictionary to prevent duplicate values for computation

In order to install and open app:
1. pip install -r requirements.txt

2. uvicorn main:app --reload
   -> starting a server, accessible at http://127.0.0.1:8000

Then, try these example API calls (for example, in Postman):

POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/compute
Body:
{
  "operation": "pow",
  "operand1": 2,
  "operand2": 4
}
or
{
  "operation": "fib",
  "operand1": 9
}
or
{
  "operation": "fact",
  "operand1": 2,
  "operand2": 4
}

With DELETE (delete by id or delete all), you will need to create a config.py file
where you initialize a token for auth like BEARER_TOKEN = "something":
DELETE http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1/operations/{replace_with_existing_operation_id}
DELETE http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1/operations

With GET (get by id or get all):
GET http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1/operations/{replace_with_existing_id}
GET http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1/operations
